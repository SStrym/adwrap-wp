# Keys Directory

This directory is used to store sensitive credential files such as service account keys.

## GCP Service Account

Place your `gcs-service-account.json` file here for Google Cloud Storage integration.

**Important:**
- Never commit actual credential files to git
- This directory is already in `.gitignore`
- Use environment-specific files if needed
